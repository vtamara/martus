Martus is a secure information management tool that allows you to create a searchable and encrypted database and back this data up remotely to your choice of publicly available servers. The Martus software is used by organizations around the world to protect sensitive information and shield the identity of victims or witnesses who provide testimony on human rights abuses.


**NOTE: The source code is split into a number of sub-projects. So if you browse the main "martus" source code, it will appear to be blank. Use the Repository dropdown to choose one of the sub-projects, and you can browse the code, view the changesets, or get instructions for how to check out that sub-project using Mercurial.**
